# lark-syntax-highlighting

A Intellj-Plugin that adds support for [lark grammars](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) to the IDE. Should work in all IDEs, but obviously most useful in PyCharm.

## Installation
*NOTE: WIP It is currently not ready for public consumption. If you install it, please be aware that it is currently only for testing. But I would greatly appreciate it if you test and tell me about any errors you come across.*

To install, you just need to download the .jar file and go in you IDE go to `Settings -> Plugins -> [Gear] -> Install from Disk`, the select the .jar file. (I might forget to keep the `.jar` file up-to-date. I'm sorry :-/)

## Roadmap

1. Fix all bugs/errors
    * For known ones, or report your own, look into the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MegaIng/lark-syntax-highlighting/issues)
2. Correct Syntax-Highlighting
3. Auto-completion inside of lark files
4. [Maybe/Very Late] Python integration, especially in regard to Transformers
